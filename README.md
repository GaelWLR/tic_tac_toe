# Tic tac toe

This project is only a quick test of `React` and other tools like `ESLint`, `Prettier` and `Parcel`.

1. Install dependancies

```
npm i
```

2. Launch local server

```
npm run dev
```

## Features

- change board size (programmatically in App.js at the moment)
- handle two player locally
- handle win and equality (even before the board is full)
